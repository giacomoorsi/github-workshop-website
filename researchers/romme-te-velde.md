# Romme te Velde

I get called many different things: Superstar, Jokerman, Neuro-surgeon, and many more. But most people just call me Romme. I am on a mission to eradicate all other people in the world named Romme... but first I would have to find them. Other than that I like basketball, history and the City of Amsterdam. And I refuse to wear contact lenses.
